<h1>So Who Am I?</h1>
<p>I am a highly motivated and organized High School student. Interested in pursuing a career
	  in the Business Field.</p>
	<h2>My Short-term Goals</h2>
<p>My short-term academic and career plans after leaving BECA is to attend college and get a job that can help me pay my college fees. I would also like to study real-estate and get a license for it. I would also like to try different experiences that help me build my resume and gain important skills not only for college or job applications but skills that can also assist me in life. </p>
	<h2>My Long Term Goals</h2>
<p>My long term professional ambitions for the future is to figure out a career that I am interested in and I would like to pursue a position in. The two careers that I am really interested in are either joining the medical field or joining the Business career path. I want to do something that helps me provide for my family, and be in a position where I am stable enough to do things that I enjoy. The people around me, and my family motivates me to do better and succeed. My position in life right now is a really important aspect of my motivation, it motivates me to become better and thrive. Another long-term goal I have is to be the first person in my family to graduate college. Itâ€™s one of my most imprtant goals  for me because I believe if one person does it in the family, there actions are a motivation for the rest to do better and also succeed</p>
